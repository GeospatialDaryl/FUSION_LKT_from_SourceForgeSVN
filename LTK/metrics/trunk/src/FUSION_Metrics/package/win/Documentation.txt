FUSION Metrics @VERSION_RELEASE@

To run the metrics programs, start the FUSION Metrics Command Prompt, and
then enter a program's name with its switches and parameters at the prompt.

To print information about the parameters and switches (also known as
"options") that a program accepts on the command line, run the program
with just the "/help" switch:

  Cloudmetrics /help
  Gridmetrics /help

Note: this version of Gridmetrics does NOT accept wildcards for the
      groundfile parameter.
